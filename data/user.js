If the trip is within a week, you will get the current weather forecast. If the trip is in the future, you will get a predicted forecast. We are going to use the Weatherbit API(https://www.weatherbit.io/api). Weatherbit API has one problem, it only takes in coordinates for weather data—it’s that specific. So, we’ll need to get those coordinates from the Geonames API(https://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html). Once we have all of this data, we’ll want to display an image of the location entered; for this, we will be using the Pixabay API(https://pixabay.com/api/docs).",
